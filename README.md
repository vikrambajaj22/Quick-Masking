# Quick-Masking
This is a MATLAB script to create binary masks for several images in a directory, one after the other, and then save the masked images to a desired directory, instead of having to create the masks individually.

This is particularly useful when you have to create masks for several images in the same folder.

IMPORTANT: 
The images must be labeled sequentially, for example: image_name1.jpg, image_name2.jpg, ..., image_namen.jpg.
